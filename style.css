/* ===== Experimenting with CSS Functions =====

I've been exploring the new CSS Functions and Mixins module. Which from what I can see, it will be a complete game-changer for how we can handle responsiveness in CSS in the future.

Instead of writing the same @media queries over and over, I have built this '--responsive' function to handle it all in one go.

Benefits of CSS Functions:

1. It applies the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and eliminates multiple @media blocks throughout the stylesheet.

2. It helps to Keep responsive values and variations of a property grouped together for better readability.

3. By using default values you can set up intelligent fallbacks to 'cascade' values up if specific breakpoints are not defined.

This is still in the experimental phase and not all browsers support it. From my research, as of January 2026, I have found that currently, this only works in Chromium-based browsers. There is no native support yet for Firefox or Safari

This is a major step forward allowing us to create custom functions in CSS!

/* ===== Here is my example =====
I have written a basic '--responsive' function which allows you to use one line of code to target 3 breakpoints, it keeps all of the values grouped nicely together in one css block. */

@function --responsive(
  --mobile,
  --tablet: var(--mobile),
  --desktop: var(--tablet)
) {
  /* Start with the Desktop view as our base */
  result: var(--desktop);

  /* Conditional Overrides for smaller screens */
  /* Adjust for Tablets */
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    result: var(--tablet);
  }

  /* Adjust for Mobile */
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    result: var(--mobile);
  }
}

body {
  /* Usage: --responsive(mobile, tablet, desktop)
  */
  background-color: --responsive(aqua, orange, red);
  font-family: --responsive("Segoe UI", "Courier New", "Verdana");
  font-size: 3rem;
}

/* For comparison here is the traditional approach which is 18 lines of code. With the function I have created it now only uses 3 lines of code */

/*
body {
  background-color: red;
  font-family: "Verdana";
  font-size: 10vw;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: orange;
    font-family: "Courier New";
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: aqua;
    font-family: "Segoe UI";
  }
}
  */
